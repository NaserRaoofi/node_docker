# SSL Certificate Directory
# 
# Place your SSL certificates here:
# - cert.pem (your SSL certificate)
# - key.pem (your private key)
#
# For development, you can generate self-signed certificates:
# openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 \
#   -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem \
#   -subj "/C=US/ST=State/L=City/O=Organization/CN=localhost"
