# Security Best Practices Checklist

## Docker Security
- [x] Using non-root user (nodejs:nodejs)
- [x] Minimal base image (Alpine Linux)
- [x] Regular security updates (apk update && apk upgrade)
- [x] No sensitive data in Dockerfile
- [x] Proper .dockerignore to exclude sensitive files
- [ ] Image vulnerability scanning (consider: docker scout, trivy)
- [ ] Container runtime security (consider: read-only filesystem)

## Application Security
- [x] Environment variables for configuration
- [x] Health checks implemented
- [ ] Input validation middleware
- [ ] Rate limiting middleware
- [ ] Security headers middleware (helmet.js)
- [ ] HTTPS enforcement in production

## Production Security
- [x] Resource limits defined
- [x] Restart policies configured
- [ ] Log aggregation setup
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Backup strategies
- [ ] Secret management (Docker Secrets, Kubernetes Secrets)

## Network Security
- [x] Internal networks defined
- [x] Minimal port exposure
- [ ] Firewall rules
- [ ] VPN/Private network access
- [ ] SSL/TLS certificates management

## Recommendations
1. Implement helmet.js for security headers
2. Add rate limiting with express-rate-limit
3. Set up log rotation and centralized logging
4. Use Docker Secrets for sensitive data in production
5. Implement container image scanning in CI/CD
6. Consider read-only filesystem for containers
7. Regular dependency updates and vulnerability scanning
8. Implement proper monitoring and alerting
